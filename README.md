# Issue Tracking System – Java & MySQL

## Project Overview
The Issue Tracking System is a **Java-based application** designed to log, track, and manage software defects efficiently. The system integrates **MySQL** as the backend database for storing issue details and provides a simple **command-line interface** for issue management. This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **Java programming**, **SQL-based data handling**, and **software development lifecycle (SDLC)** practices.

This project aligns with industry-standard practices for software development, issue management, and Agile methodologies, making it a practical tool for understanding **issue reporting, tracking, and resolution** in enterprise applications.
